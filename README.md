A **space-filling curve** is a continuous surjection $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]^d$ for
$d\ge 2$. In discrete spaces, this is an ordering of grid cells that visits
every cell; some orderings preserve adjacency (e.g., Hilbert), while others
trade adjacency for simplicity (e.g., Morton/Z-order).

This project contains implementations of various space-filling curves, plus
tools for visualising and working with them.

A Rust library for generating and working with space-filling curves.

<!-- snips: crates/spacecurve/examples/hilbert.rs#example -->
```rust
// 2D Hilbert curve on an 8x8 grid (order 3)
let curve = spacecurve::curve_from_name("hilbert", 2, 8)?;
println!(
    "{}D Hilbert length: {} cells",
    curve.dimensions(),
    curve.length()
);

let index = 10;
let point = curve.point(index);
println!("Point at index {index}: {:?}", point);

let round_trip = curve.index(&point);
println!("Index for {:?}: {round_trip}", point);

assert_eq!(round_trip, index);
```

A command-line tool and GUI for generating images of space-filling curves. 

Install with `cargo install scurve`.


# playground

A GUI for visualising space-filling curves and their properties, written in
Rust with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and compiled to WebAssembly.
