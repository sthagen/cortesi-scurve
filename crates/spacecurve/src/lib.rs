//! Core library for working with space‑filling curves.
//!
//! Exposes curve implementations and the [`SpaceCurve`] trait used by the CLI
//! and GUI crates in this workspace.
//!
//! # Supported Curves
//!
//! - Hilbert
//! - Z-order (Morton)
//! - Gray Code
//! - H-curve
//! - Scan (Boustrophedon)
//! - Onion / Hairy Onion (experimental)

/// Implementations of specific space‑filling curves.
